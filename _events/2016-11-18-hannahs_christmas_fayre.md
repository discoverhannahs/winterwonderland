Boasting over 90 specialty stalls selling the likes of crafts, hand painted ceramics, cards, jewellery, homeware, textiles, toys, soap, art and more, our annual gift fair is the perfect place to get Christmas wrapped-up nice and early. The popular food marquee will be back, while to add to the Christmas atmosphere our skating rink will be operating in the quad, while little ones will love the 50 ft bouncy snowman!

**Friday 11am – 4pm. Saturday 10am – 4pm. Adults £3, under 16’s free.**
