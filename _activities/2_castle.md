Come and enjoy a bounce on our Christmas-themed bouncy castle, with soft snowballs to play with! The castle will be operating from Wednesday to Sunday, except during high winds or rain. Â£2 per 15 minutes of happy, bouncy fun!

*Please note that due to safety concerns about wind speeds, we took the decision to replace the giant snowman with this Christmas-themed bouncy castle. We are sorry for any disappointment that this may cause, but the new attraction is far safer and just as much fun!*
