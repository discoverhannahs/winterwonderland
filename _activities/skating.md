Our large synthetic rink is environmentally-friendly and accessible for all abilities. Expect a real Christmas atmosphere with music, stalls and hot chocolate, mulled wine and sweet treats available. Remember to wrap-up warm and wear gloves and nice thick socks.

Tickets for most sessions can be brought from our Skate Hut on the day and are for a 45 minute skate, although we can be more flexible on timings at quieter times.

Pre-booked tickets are available for our special events including [Themed Thursdays](#Thursdays), [Disco Skate Saturdays](#Saturdays), Film and Skate Sundays, the Schoolâ€™s Out Christmas Party and our Skate and Chips evening. Booking is highly advised for these events, so please call 01626 325800 or see our [events section](#Events) below to book online.

**Help us staff this event!** We have paid vacancies available for
